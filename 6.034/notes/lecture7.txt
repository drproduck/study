martial art principle: use constraints to avoid getting further

domain reduction alg

for each dfs assignment
    for each variable vi considered
        for each xi in Di
	    for each constraint c(xi, xj) where xj in Dj
		if not exist xj in c(xi, xj) satified
		    remove xi from Di
		if empty then backup
use most constrained first
propagate through domain produced to a single algorithm
converge to best domain size
